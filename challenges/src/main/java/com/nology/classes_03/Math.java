 * -------------- Advanced -----------------
 *
 * The Math class is a chance for you to implement your own version of the inbuilt Math class.
 * With additional methods.
 *
 * DO NOT USE THE INBUILT MATH CLASS
 *
 * This is a skeleton of a class you will have to complete it by following these steps.
 * - Adding data fields / properties
 * - Implement getters and setters
 * - Implementing three methods
 *
 * Each step is documented through the class.
